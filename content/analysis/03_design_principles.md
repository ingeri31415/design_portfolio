Styles on 'About me' pages
=======================

This study concludes an examination on the design of 'about me' pages on three different blogs and a comparison with my own about me page. 

Urval
-----------------------

To choose the blogs I looked up blogs worth reading in 2023 and found the following <a href='https://influencedigest.com/top-global-rankings/top-15-personal-blogs-you-should-follow-2023/'>webstie</a>. From there I went through them and chose the top three that were named after the person and had a separate about page about the person therefore discarding Cal Newpoert's blog becuase it simply had the about me section as an aside on the main page and Chris Guillebeau because the about page was not about him at all. 

The three chosen blogs are the blogs of the following three people: <a href='https://tim.blog/about/'>Tim Ferris</a>, <a href='https://jamesclear.com/about'>James Clear</a> and <a href='https://www.chasejarvis.com/about/'>Chase Jarvis</a>.

Metod
-----------------------

In this experiment I have used this  <a href='https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/'>article</a> to define the design principles. I looked more closely at the page with information about the person behind it i.e. for the other websites their about page but for my own it is the home page since the about page is not about me but about the page. 

Resultat
-----------------------

#### Page 1 - Tim Ferriss
The Tim Ferriss blog is about business and productivity. His blog seems to mainly promote his podcast by giving information about what each episode is about aswell as promoting the books he has written and the newsletter he sends out every week. 

For the design of the about page which he calls his bio we are imediately met with a big picture of himself combined with a text box where you can subscribe to his news letter which is the header of the webpage. This is followed by black text and blue links/buttons in two columns.

Here we can see some balance in that he has put himself next to the box and they are pretty much the same size. The picture is of him in nature with a green/blue/grey theme which does contrast a lot to the white of the textbox and especially the yellow of the button. Additionally further down the design continues being split into two almost the same sized columns creating a grid for the page.

When it comes to the goal of the webpage my personal oppinion is that he manages to really promote his newsletter since he has put it up there on top right next to his picture which for me is the only thing above the fold (see picture below). Additionally, what comes next is equal split between where you can find his podcast and subcribe to it and information about him. His main goals are in the four first things that the viewer of the blog sees. To me it seems a little strange to have a header so big that it is the only thing above the fold (at least for me). That makes it hard to know which page I have reached when clicking around the page and makes the first impression of each subpage underwhelming.

The other subpages follow in similar style where we have the big header and the aside column is the same. For the rest of the content it is mostly black text and blue links just like the about me page. The only difference is that the <a href='https://tim.blog/podcast/'>Podcast page</a> has a couple of black buttons which is not seen anywhere else.

#### Page 2 - James Clear

James Clear's blog is about self-imporvment. Here you can learn from articles, read quote from different people and find about his books, where his comming speeches and his 3-2-1 newletter. 

The first thing to note about the design on this page is that it is very little colour. There is black text on white background and the only little colour is that there's yellow dots in a bullet list which gives a some contrast. It is also very interesting that as a reader you are not imediately greated with a picture in the about section. 

The design is very scaled back and that brings the focus to the grid system which starts with two columns goes down to one column and then goes to three columns before going back to two columns again. This makes it so that there is a little lack of balacne over all. Looking at the page above the fold for me which looks like this for me (see picture below), the page is heavier on the left with a paragraph and lighter with a bullet list. In my oppinion your eyes are drawn to the list which also can be because of it is the only thing with colour on the page. If looking closely, one can spot that there is some framing of the first and last section (those in two colums) where the white background is a little more grey than the rest of the page.

As for the other subpages the design is very simiar, very much black and white with the occational hint of yellow as an accent colour. All pages are also divided into columns in some sort. The more greyish white also reoccur on the top of all pages and at the bottom of some of them.  

Does the page fit in with the goal. Obviously there is information on James himself but also there is a lot on what the blog is, what James has done and how the page can help the reader which is inline with being an about page but also keeping it to informative on self-improvement.

#### Page 3 - Chase Jarvis

His blog is about creativity and entrepreneurship where he shares knowledge about photography, film making, creativity and business. The goal is to inspire you to be creative in your life and learn how to create a creative business industry. 

The theme is very black and white and the pictures as well even though they are not completely so. This creates unity in the page. The picture is very well done with having the bright circle focus on his face making your eyes focus on the most important part of the picture. As well as having the white t-shirt contrast against the black background without the light. It is also incorporated in the text unifying it for the ”about chase” section. There is also contrast in how different width of the letter in the header (and obviously between headings and text on the page).  The link to get his book creative calling is more bold than the other links in the header which creates some kind of hierarchy in there. 

The goal of the page does what it should. It informs about him and then there is some contact information as well as links to his social media where you can find out more. 

As for the other subpage of the cite there is more grid based pages with the galleries of his pictures and projects. The actual blog has more photos and much more colour as well as being busier in the aside. This contrasts the monochrome of the about page and the simplistic design of the galleries. 

#### My page (home)
The goal is of the home page is to inform the user of who the person behind the site is and welcome them to the page.Additionaly, get the person to want to stay on the cite
The first thing to notice is that there is very little there simply two lines of text and a single picture. The picture does and some depth to the page since it has a piece of cake in the forground and then some other cake in the background which is blurry. The page lacks balance since everything is to the left and there is nothing to the right in the content part of the page. The header is more balcanced since there is stuff in the upper left corner and in the bottom right. However, it feels a bit streched. There is a little bit of movement in regards to the navbar in the header when hovering over the links (and of course change in colour). The movement does emphasize the change when moving from one link to another. 
In terms of the goals, it is very simplistic and could be more infromation on there. The greeting does it's job but the question is if just welcoming the user is enough to want them to stay which is debatable. Also, there is not much on there to do besides look at the cake picture. 
The other subpages does not differ too much but they do have more text or more pictures which makes them more interesting. 

Analys
-----------------------
The three pages are all having white as their background and black (or grey) text which is very usual on the web. However, I feel like it can also be for readablity and creating a sesrious look for the page. Additionally, they all handle topics about self-improvement and work which is more of a serious topic and less for fun. For James Clear and Chase Jarvis the choise seems more intentional since the themes are black and white and very little else. Whereas Tim Ferriss' blog has much more colour intergrated with some colourful pictures and a lot of blue links and buttons. All of them have the navbar at the very top and their name in the top left corner of it. We can see that Jarvis' and Clear's contiuing to be similar in that they do not have anything else in the terms of a header wheres Ferriss' has a very large one. Another thing is that they look very airy and spacious letting the backgroud come through. Ferriss' has a lot more going on which creates a busier page. They all have their social media information linked in the beginning of the page. (Although Jarivs has links at the bottom as well).

Intrestiingly enough, I found that out of the 3 pages 2 did the same and one did the opposite so there was not many conclusions to draw from this. Naturally a picture of them selves seemed likely to be at the top of the page but Clear's page did not have that. The very stripped back black and white theme was not found at Ferriss' page. The search bar in the top right corner did not exist in clear's page either. The set of pages was small anyway so conclusions overall are not particularly telling anyways. However, all of the themes did give a feeling of business and being informative rather than being a fun website which does go with inline with their self-improvement content on their blogs.
