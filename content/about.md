Used techniques 
==================

On this webpage I've used SASS to create the style. Specifically, I've used variables in the variables.scss to set the colours. I've divided up the css code into a couple of different pages as mentioned variables but also header and footer. Additionally, I used some nested rules in the header.scss file.  

I have chosen fairly simple style with white background and almost black text. I then added an accent colour to liven it up. For fonts I've used poiret and lato from Google fonts. I looked at their recommended pairings and chose a simple one I liked. I've used Font Awesome to create the little logos in the footer. The Facebook and Youtube ones just lead to their start pages since there isn't any specific page to link to for those websites. As for the responsiveness it is the same as in the exercise for kmom02.
